# Embedded-System (Arduino)
All the exercises of my Embedded System class 
Here are all the exercises that my teams did in my Embedded System class. You can find these exercises in the book Beginning Arduino written by Michael McRoberts.
Folders that start with "Chuong" are exercises of corresponding chapter in the book. The rest are extra excercises or improved version of original excercises.
The instruction for setting up equipment are written in HƯỚNG-DẪN-LẮP-MẠCH-CODE.docx so check it out!!
